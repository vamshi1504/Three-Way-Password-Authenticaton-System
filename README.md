# Three-Way-Password-Authenticaton-System
Abstract:
Personal identification numbers (PINs) are frequently used to verify the identity of a user and for other security purposes. It is possible to crack the password via shoulder surfing or thermal monitoring while using PIN based password authentication. Hands -free eye-blink PIN authentication. Instead, PIN input techniques leave no tangible evidence of the userâ€™s activity, making them a more secure alternative to entering a password. PIN generation is known as eye blinks-based authentication, in which the PIN is generated by finding the eye blinks in successive picture frames. This project presents a real-time application that integrates eye blink-based PIN input, face recognition, and OTP to avoid attacks by shoulder surfing and thermal tracking (One Time Password). The three-way authentication system contains three levels of authentication where user needs to clear all the three levels to successfully login to the system the three layers of the system are Face recognition second level is eye blinking based password entering and last level is OTP verification through email of the user. For registered users only can be able to authenticate all the three levels and successfully log into machine or website.
